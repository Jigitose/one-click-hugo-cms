      text: "What Is Modafinil?
Modafinil was designed to promote wakefulness due to various sleep disorders. Realizing its potency and tolerability, elites quickly use it for other off-label (or recreational) purposes such as for cognitive-enhancing effects to increase productivity, wakefulness, alertness, focus, and concentration. Think of it as a super-charging the brain’s cognitive output.

Primarily, it’s approved by the FDA to medicate people with narcolepsy, shift work sleep disorder, and other excessive sleepiness due to obstructive sleep apnea or hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). It’s a highly potent drug in treating patients with non-sleep related conditions like ADHD, multiple sclerosis, clinical depression, Parkinson’s disease, mental disorders as well as individuals with impaired cognitive function problems [1].

Is It a Nootropic?
Modafinil is classified as both a nootropic and a eugeroic. A eugeroic is any substance that induces promoting effects of wakefulness by inhibiting sleepiness. Take caffeine as an example of this since it is one of the well-known types of eugeroic substances.

Eugeroic substances like modafinil increase the neurotransmitters linked with the sensation of wakefulness.

Wakefulness

Nootropics boost cognitive function, and modafinil falls to this category [2]. Why? Because it’s used to enhance memory and concentration. Most nootropics boost cognitive levels, thus promoting workflow efficiency.

People under the influence of modafinil experience supercharged cognitive output due to the raised levels of neurotransmitters including dopamine. On the contrary, patients with ADHD have lower concentrations of dopamine causing them to experience challenges in paying attention or achieving focus on tasks.

How Does Modafinil Work?
The mechanism of action of modafinil is not widely known. Scientists report that the drug engages different brain neurotransmitters that are associated with mental acuity, focus, and concentration.

Nonetheless, modafinil functions by stimulating the human brain. It is thought to work through several varying pathways in the brain that culminate together to better the entire process of wake-promoting effects and cognitive functions.

Primarily, it increases the amount of dopamine by lowering its reuptake into brain nerves. In clinical studies, modafinil shows neuroprotective and antioxidative effects in which a raise in cortical creatine or a decrease in brain oxidation promotes brain vigilance. The entire processes exert neuroprotective and wake-promoting effects [3].

Modafinil inhibits the “tiredness-promoting” active compounds in the brain by activating glutamatergic circuits while impeding GABA to exert stimulatory effects.

Is Modafinil a Controlled Substance?
In the USA, the use of modafinil is regulated. It is classified as a Schedule IV substance [4].

Each country has its own controls regarding the use or import of drugs. In Australia, importing drugs from an online store, provided it’s not a prohibited drug (which requires a permit), is legal with a prescription. The importer must fulfill an order of a maximum of 3 months’ supply for personal use [5].

China classified this med as a Class I psychotropic drug, and the use of it is strictly controlled. Still, doctors can only prescribe it to patients for not more than 3-day use.

Prescription Medication

Countries such as the UK, South Africa, Canada, Finland, and Mexico, among others, have not labeled modafinil as a control substance but require a valid prescription in order to use it.

You can order this med in India without any problem from a pharmacy or online vendors.

Check if your country prohibits the use of this drug so as to avoid problems that might arise from customs when importing or risk being tracked and jailed.

Is This Drug a Stimulant?
Modafinil might have stimulant-like effects, but its mode of action depicts a much lower level of potential addiction and risk of side effects. Although it might share some biochemical mechanisms with addictive stimulant drugs, its addiction and dependence liabilities are relatively low [6].

Unlike most stimulants (categorized as Schedule II controlled substances) with a higher degree of potential abuse and dependence, modafinil is a Schedule IV controlled substance. It has impressive features that distinguish it from other stimulants such as amphetamines. In fact, modafinil is an ideal med applied as an antipsychotic or anti-fatigue agent [7].

It has less negative therapeutic effects and doesn’t interfere with normal sleep or produce tolerance. It’s the ideal drug that improves vigilance in sleep-deprived people and works remarkably in boosting cognitive functions and mood elevations [8].

    text: Is This Nootropic Worth It?
As a powerful nootropic, modafinil helps you achieve enhanced memory, concentration, neural efficiency, and improved workflow. That’s why the guys at Silicon Valley use this med to increase their coding efficiency with a supercharged brain. It can be hard to crack the 0’s and 1’s with the non-focused or low energized brain.

Productivity

In fact, this drug rewards you when it comes to tasks that demand higher acuity. Think of technical tasks that need complex thinking, wakefulness or alertness.

Who dares not praise the remarkable effects that come with this med? Being high on modafinil is far more beneficial and rewarding, particularly when it comes to productivity, motivation, vigilance, and improved moods. That’s why we recommend it. You can learn detailed information in the article “Modafinil Effects: Here’s What to Expect When Taking It”.

What Does This Medicine Do to the Brain?
While striving to deal with those executive functions, cognition-enhancing modafinil gets it done with ease. But what exactly does it do to the brain?

Modafinil works by stimulating the brain through various chemical processes. In particular, it improves only certain features of brain cognition known as executive function. It increases the amount of dopamine in the brain by decreasing its reuptake into nerves [9].

By inhibiting and altering the concentrations of dopamine and related chemical neurotransmitters, modafinil indirectly upregulates the activity (or increases the response) in attention and executive control networks in the brain. These effects are then hypothesized to permit individuals to effectively execute cognitive tasks, particularly those demanding good focus and problem solving.

What Does Drug Feel Like?
Individuals with sleep-deprived conditions are prescribed this medicine to make them stay awake. Healthy people and ADHD sufferers using it in an off-label way find it extremely motivating.

To many, modafinil produces extreme bursts of motivation to get tasks done. In ADHD individuals who find cognitive demanding tasks boring or tedious, this smart med eliminates these challenges with motivation. It becomes easy to keep on focus on cognitively demanding tasks and power through.

And that’s not all, this med makes us feel very awake and vigilant. This is the effect narcoleptics experience when they are on modafinil – it stimulates the active pathways in the brain linked with wakefulness.

With these two effects, it becomes very easy to do tasks feeling motivated, very awake and focused. As long as there are still enough levels of active medicine in the body, you can keep going with any activity with acuity without getting tired and bored.

Does It Raise Blood Pressure?
Modafinil is really a smart drug with fewer negative effects. Most people use this med without experiencing any adverse reactions. Should you worry about its effect on blood pressure? Here is another awakening point on this med.

Blood Pressure

First, this is not something to worry about, but you should be aware of it. During the short-term treatment with modafinil, it does not cause a significant effect on blood pressure provided that you do not take a physical or mental performance test [10].

Other studies show that this med negatively affects blood pressure and associated aspects of the cardiovascular system but not at a higher level compared to other stimulants [11].

If you have cardiovascular issues, then this drug should be administered with care. Always check with a doctor prior to using modafinil medicine. Nonetheless, for people aged 45 and below who are healthy, this med in regards to blood pressure should not be a big concern.

Does Modafinil Work for Everyone?
Different people experience varying effects of modafinil. In rare cases, some individuals may not feel any response at all, or the effects failed to “kick in”. Can it be a bad batch of the smart drug?

The new users of this drug can be non-responsive. The opposite is true for those long-term users who have been on higher doses, and the drug has damaged their tolerance.

If you are a new user, starting with a dose of 50–100 mg, increase it to 200 mg or higher and test if the effects kick in. In doing so, keep yourself busy. Don’t wait for the active substance to kick in.

Another trick is to combine it with coffee. In fact, caffeine mixes well with smart drugs such as modafinil and can help the nootropic’s effects show faster.

If you are a long-term user, try these tricks:

halt taking it for 1 week to 1 month;
reduce modafinil intake to 1-3 times/week;
reduce the dose to 200-300 mg.
There might be other factors contributing to the low effects of modafinil smart drug [12], [13].

How Long Does Drug Take to Kick In?
For most people, it can take as little as 30 minutes to an hour for it to kick in. But like any other medicine, depending on several factors, the onset of action can vary from individual to individual.

Clock

Factors such as overall health, age, and the sleep disorder or condition that’s being treated may prolong the onset of effects.

Weight and diet can also influence the time it takes for modafinil to kick in. Overweight individuals may notice the effects slower than those who are healthy.

Food can also affect how long it takes for modafinil medicine to work. Your body can’t effectively perform too many functions simultaneously. The same applies if the body is too occupied in digesting food; then it will take more time for modafinil to make its way into the bloodstream.

So can you take it on an empty stomach? Probably, it can cause some mild irritation. The best approach is to take it with a small amount of food and give some time to experience the effects.
