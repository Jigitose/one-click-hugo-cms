What Is Modafinil?
Modafinil is a wakefulness agent first developed in France and owned by Cephalon Labs. It is FDA-approved to promote alertness in people with sleep apnea, narcolepsy and shift work sleep disorder [1].

Many off-label prescriptions are written by physicians for conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression and addiction, as well [2, 3].

This is because modafinil also provides a number of other cognition-enhancing effects, in addition to promoting alertness and wakefulness. It may improve focus, attentiveness, decision-making skills, and task performance [4, 5].

For this reason, modafinil is also widely considered one of the best nootropic “smart drugs.”

Modafinil Side Effects and Safety?
The most commonly reported side effects of modafinil from nootropics researchers include insomnia, loss of appetite and headache.

To alleviate insomnia, it’s important to take modafinil early in the day. This will provide the lasting alertness and wakefulness needed to be productive, and — with modafinil’s 12-15 hour half-life, most of the effects of the agent will have worn off when it’s time to go to sleep [6].

Additionally, many subjects report that the cause of the appetite loss seemed to stem from focus enhancements that kept them so wrapped up in the task at hand that they forgot to eat.

Finally, many researchers say that drinking plenty of water helped alleviate headaches associated with modafinil.

Here is a more comprehensive list of potential side effects from the U.S. National Library of Medicine [7]:

“headache
dizziness
difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep
drowsiness
nausea
diarrhea
constipation
gas
heartburn
loss of appetite
unusual tastes
dry mouth
excessive thirst
nosebleed
flushing
sweating
tight muscles or difficulty moving
back pain
confusion
uncontrollable shaking of a part of your body
burning, tingling, or numbness of the skin
difficulty seeing or eye pain”
Additionally, they list the following severe side effects that warrant medical attention:

“rash
blisters
peeling skin
mouth sores
hives
itching
hoarseness
difficulty breathing or swallowing
swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs
chest pain
fast, pounding, or irregular heartbeat
frenzied, abnormally excited mood
hallucinating (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist)
anxiety
depression
thinking about killing or harming yourself”
Modafinil may also interact with certain drugs, so it should be used with caution and physician approval in people with existing medical conditions or who are taking prescription medications.

Additionally, minors under the age of 18 and pregnant or breastfeeding women shouldn’t use modafinil unless it’s prescribed.

Finally, modafinil shouldn’t be mixed with other stimulants, depressants, alcohol, illicit drugs, or high doses of caffeine.
