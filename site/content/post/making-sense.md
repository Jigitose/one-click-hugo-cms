Modafinil is a potent wakefulness agent that also provides nootropic benefits.

However, it should not be snorted. This is because it was not developed for snorting, it’s not water soluble and there is no powder form available. However, even if a subject finds a so-called powder form of modafinil to purchase, there are shipping concerns, problems with attaining the proper dosage and the product is likely adulterated and potentially unsafe.
