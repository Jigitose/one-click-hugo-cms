title: 'Snort Modafinil?'

  Drugs that are commonly snorted, like the illicit drug cocaine, are taken this way because it provides almost immediate effects — which, in general, is the singular benefit of this method of administration.

Here are several reasons why we don’t recommend snorting modafinil, even though it means subjects will need to wait longer to feel the effects.

Not developed for snorting
Modafinil is available in pill or sublingual tablet form (which is dissolved under the tongue), but mostly as a pill you swallow.

For this reason, it contains some fillers necessary to stabilize the drug in pill form. For this reason it shouldn’t be snorted.

Additionally, it would need to be crushed to a very fine powder before snorting — which would also reduce the convenience of such a method of administration.

Powder form unavailable
A powder form of modafinil used to be available from Sun Pharmaceuticals, but it’s no longer offered. In fact, none of the modafinil manufacturers that we’re aware of produce modafinil powder.

If it were meant to be snorted, a powder form would likely be available. However, this lack of availability for powder should speak volumes — considering the high demand for modafinil as a prescription drug and nootropic.

## A little history

Dosing concerns
It’s also difficult to measure and administer a dose for snorting.

First, it requires a way to crush the pills into a consistently fine powder. It also requires a milligram scale for precise measurements. Finally, the subject must be able to snort the full dose.

There is a lot of room for error in these steps, which is why it’s much better to simply take a 100mg or 200mg pill. For smaller doses, a pill splitter can easily and precisely divide pills in two.

## What you need to know before trying

Water insoluble
Modafinil is not soluble in water, meaning it won’t dissolve in water. This may make it extremely painful and uncomfortable to snort [8].

Shipping concerns
Powder forms of modafinil, if sourced, may not arrive. While small amounts of pills may discreetly make their way through customs and shipping, powders (particularly bulk purchases) will be under much more intense scrutiny and are more likely to be seized.

Adulteration
Finally, because no reputable manufacturers that we know of produce powder modafinil, subjects shouldn’t trust modafinil powder available online. It’s likely to be inauthentic or adulterated, and could potentially be unsafe.

All this is to say that no, modafinil should under no circumstances be snorted. For subjects who are concerned about the timing of effect onset, sublingual tablets are a better alternative. Otherwise, the safest and best option is to take modafinil pills as early in the day as possible to account for the waiting period before they take effect. This will provide the benefit of making it easier to go to sleep at night, since it’s more likely the drug will be out of the system by bedtime.
